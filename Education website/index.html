             Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, 
             skills, values, beliefs, and habits.
             Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. 
             Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. 
             Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks,
             feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy
             We are providing Ncert syllabus for junior and senior students and we are also providing some technical lectures also

        History of Education
    </p>
    <p class="sectionsubclass small-para ">
        
        Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. 
        In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. 
        Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. 
        As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed.
